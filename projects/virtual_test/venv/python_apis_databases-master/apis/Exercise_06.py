Create an application that interfaces with the user via the CLI - prompt the user with a menu such as:

Please select from the following options (enter the number of the action you'd like to take):
1) Create a new account (POST)
2) View all your tasks (GET)
3) View your completed tasks (GET)
4) View only your incomplete tasks (GET)
5) Create a new task (POST)
